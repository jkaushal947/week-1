    <p>Is there any way of reviewing the new series opener of The Grand Tour without reviewing Jeremy Clarkson? Probably not, because the two are so deeply intertwined as to be inseparable, as the BBC discovered to their cost when they continued Top Gear without him. So, let’s just get a few of Jeremy’s more predictable pet hates out of the way, including Teslas, coffee shops, rock music made after the year 1979, and vegetables – or what he calls “vegetablism”. Although from the sight of Jezza’s increasingly turbo-charged tummy, he could perhaps do with a strict regime of vegetabilism.</p>
